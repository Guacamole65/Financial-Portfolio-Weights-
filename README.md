# Financial-Portfolio-Weights 

A simple and user-friendly Python project that computes portfolio weights using live market data fetched through the yfinance library.

It retrieves up-to-date asset prices, calculates returns, applies basic portfolio theory, and displays the results in a clear and intuitive format.

This is my first true Python project in finance, focused on learning how to work with real financial data, APIs/libraries, and practical portfolio calculations.
